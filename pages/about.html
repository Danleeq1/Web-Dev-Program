          <h4>Why programming/development?</h4>
          <br> 
          <p>Learning and working with technology has always been an interest of mine. Keeping up with the current mobile
            devices,gaming systems, and computers has always intrigued me.
            I started coding in High School with playing around with JavaScript for a class and loved it. Coding fell to
            the backburner for me as I went to school and worked for a few years. Now, I decided to pursure something that
            I have had a major interest in for a good portion of my life.
